# Triangle Generator

This program will print out a pattern with numbers and stars (asterisks). 
1. It will first prompt for the height of the pattern. If the user enters an invalid input such as a 
negative number or zero, an error message will be printed and the user will be prompted again.
2. Each symbol(either a number or space) should be separated by a tab (not space) 
3. Then your program should print the following pattern using numbers and stars with a tab 
between each of them.
